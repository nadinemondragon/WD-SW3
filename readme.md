## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Description of the project in details.

Guiding Question:
- What is the project?
The project is to create a website featuring distinct header and footer designs using pure HTML and CSS. The headers and footers should have both static and animated versions. The end goal is a well-structured, visually appealing website that is properly deployed and documented.

- Whats the purpose?
The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to design and implement unique website components (headers and footers) using only HTML and CSS, without relying on JavaScript or external libraries. It also aims to show proficiency in structuring a website and deploying it on a web server, as well as maintaining clear project documentation.

- What are key components?
Header Designs:

Static Header: A header with fixed elements that do not change or move.
Animated Header: A header with CSS animations, such as transitions, keyframes, or hover effects.
Footer Designs:

Static Footer: A footer with fixed elements that do not change or move.
Animated Footer: A footer with CSS animations, similar to the animated header.
Webpage Structure:

HTML Document: The main file that includes the structure of the webpage.
CSS Stylesheet: A file (or files) that contain the styles and animations for the headers and footers.
Deployment: The process of making the website live on the internet through a web server or a hosting service.
README File: A markdown file that contains documentation on how to set up, run, and understand the project.

- What technology used and how it is used?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

Purpose: Provides the structure of the website.
Static Styling: CSS rules are used to apply colors, fonts, layouts, and other visual styles to the HTML elements.
Animations: CSS animations, such as transitions and keyframes, are used to create animated effects in the headers and footers. For example:
Transitions: Smoothly change properties like color, size, or position over a specified duration.
Keyframes: Define complex animations by specifying intermediate steps.
Deployment Tools:

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
